# Complex Visualization
G20 Countries: Government Spending on Military, Health and Education

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to continue learning and improving skills in complex visualization and information theory by manipulating and analyzing the military, education and health spending of 10 nations.

## Assumptions and Questions
It is a commonly held assumption that the United States spends more on its military, health and education than other countries, given it is one of the wealthiest and largest countries in the world. Our goal for this project will to visualize the actual spending relative to other countries, gross domestic product (GDP), per-capita spending and overall government spending.

## Tools
For this excerise we used Python 3 in Jupyter for analyzing and preparing the data, with the Pandas data manipulation and analysis library. For visualization, we leveraged the Google Charts API, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and jQuery. Source code management and hosting leveraged GitHub.
